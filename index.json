[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Can (online) media influence thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors? Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this question has become increasingly more relevant. My research explores a specific - and potentially unintended - type of influence; namely the effect of stereotypic and biased language. For example, what happens when we repeatedly read \u0026ldquo;Millennials are lazy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Millennials don\u0026rsquo;t work hard enough\u0026rdquo;? Does it induce/decrease/increase the stereotype we already had of millenials? After exploring the effect biased language can have on stereotypic representations of social groups, we will also explore the effects on subsequent behavior. Finally, we will work towards guidelines for decreasing the amount of streotypical language in a text.\nAffiliations I\u0026rsquo;m conducting my work as part of the Institute for Logic, Lanugauge and Computation at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\nCollaborations For ongoing collaborations (e.g., my supervisors) please see the bias-barometer project website\nFunding The research we conduct is funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) as part of the project The Biased Reality of Online Media\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"eee3725ad9872eabe30bbc9ad70884fc","permalink":"/author/sally-hogenboom/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sally-hogenboom/","section":"authors","summary":"Can (online) media influence thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors?
